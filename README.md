In this Project, I will use pre-downloaded datasets to understand the nuts and bolts of Twitter Data. In particular, I will do a thorough analysis of a hot-trend.
The following are the steps:
1. Local and global thought patterns
2. Prettifying the output
3. Finding common trends
4. Exploring the hot trend
5. Digging deeper
6. Frequency analysis
7. Activity around the trend
8. A table that speaks a 1000 words
9. Analyzing used languages
10. Final thoughts
